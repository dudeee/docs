# Internationalization

 We love our local languages, that's why we give you the ability to translate Dude to your language.
 
 You can find our [`locales` folder](https://github.com/dudeee/dude/tree/master/locales) in the repository and contribute by translating the strings from English to your language.
 
 Plugins can also provide localized strings by creating their own `locales` folder and loading it.
