# Installing Dude

 There are two ways to install Dude. You can either [grab the code and run it on your own servers](/dude/content/getting_started.md), or you can let us handle it for you.
 
 In case you want to us to handle the maintenance for you and provide you with a panel to control your bot, head over to our pricing page for more details.
